        "**Why Custom Vision for Research:**\n",
        "- **No ML expertise required** - visual training interface\n",
        "- **Small data friendly** - works with as few as 5 images per category  \n",
        "- **Research-ready APIs** - confidence scores and batch processing\n",
        "- **Scalable** - handles thousands of images via REST API\n",

        "By the end of this tutorial, you will understand how to create a custom image classification model that can automatically identify wildlife species in camera trap images, demonstrating the practical application of AI in ecological research."

        "- **Reliable downloads**: Uses proper headers to avoid being blocked by image servers\n",
        "- **Error handling**: Continues processing even if some images fail to download\n",

        "\n",
        "**What happens during upload:**\n",
        "1. Downloads each image from its URL\n",
        "2. Resizes oversized images to fit Azure's requirements\n",
        "3. Associates each image with its correct category (tag)\n",
